# review-client

review-client serves as an application-level protocol implementation for the
REview ecosystem, utilizing QUIC for communication between agents. It builds
upon the message exchange framework provided by [oinq], focusing on high-level
operations, data manipulation, and protocol-specific features tailored to
facilitate efficient and secure communication within the REview ecosystem.
